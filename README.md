## `pytest-dbt-conventions`

_A pytest plugin for linting a dbt project's conventions_

```
pip install pytest pytest-dbt-conventions
```

For a demo project using this linter, please see the `conventions.py` file of the [`poffertjes_shop`](https://github.com/tjwaterman99/poffertjes_shop) project.

### Quickstart

This plugin allows you to lint the conventions of your dbt project using pytest.

To use the plugin, you first need to _compile_ your dbt project.

```
dbt compile
```

Next, create a file called `conventions.py` in the root of your dbt project. Here's an example `conventions.py` file, with a single rule that requires all models in your dbt project to have a description.

```py
# conventions.py

def test_models_have_descriptions(model):
    assert model.description is not None

```

To run the linter, use `pytest`.

```
pytest -v conventions.py
```

You'll see output similar to the following.

### Allowing exceptions

Sometimes you expect certain models to fail the linter, so you want the linter to skip testing those models. This often happens when you're implementing a new linting rule for an existing project, and haven't yet fixed all the issues it discovers.

To skip a test for a specifc model, you can use [`pytest.xfail()`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/skipping.html#xfail-mark-test-functions-as-expected-to-fail).


```py
# conventions.py

import pytest

exception_list = ['orders', 'order_items']

def test_models_have_descriptions(model):
    if model.name in exception_list:
        pytest.xfail(f"Allowing failure in {model.name}")

    assert model.description is not None

```

### Using fixtures

This plugin provides several [_fixtures_](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html#what-fixtures-are) you can use in your `conventions.py` file. 

A fixture is the object that pytest provides to each of your test functions. 

For example, in the function below, the test function is called `test_sources_have_snapshots`, and the fixture is the argument `source` that gets passed to that test function.

```py
def test_sources_have_snapshots(source):
    assert len(source.snapshots) > 0
```

The available fixtures provided by this plugin are listed below, along with a simple usage example and a link to their reference documentation.

#### `model`

An object that represents the models in your project.

```py
def test_model_resource_type(model):
    assert model.resource_type == 'model'
```

Reference: https://tjwaterman99.github.io/artefacts/reference.html?highlight=manifestnode#artefacts.core.ManifestNode


#### `source`

An object that represents the sources defined in your project.

```py
def test_sources_have_snapshots(source):
    assert len(source.snapshots) > 0
```

Reference: https://tjwaterman99.github.io/artefacts/reference.html?highlight=manifestsourcenode#artefacts.core.ManifestSourceNode

#### `manifest`

An object that represents the entire manifest artifact generated by `dbt compile`.

```py
def test_manifest_has_nodes(manifest):
    assert len(manifest.nodes) > 0
```

Reference: https://tjwaterman99.github.io/artefacts/reference.html?highlight=manifest#artefacts.core.Manifest
